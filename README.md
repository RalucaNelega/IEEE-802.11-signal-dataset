# üì° IEEE 802.11 Synthetic RF Signal Dataset

This dataset was generated as part of a research effort aimed at improving RF signal classification using deep learning, while addressing challenges related to data scarcity and environmental variability. Large datasets are crucial to capture the diverse characteristics of real-world wireless scenarios. However, practical constraints on storage and processing require that the training and testing sets remain within reasonable bounds. To address this, a carefully selected set of parameters was used to generate a finite yet representative dataset.

In total, **134,400 synthetic IEEE 802.11 signals** were generated as complex I/Q samples. These samples replicate real transmission behaviors under different modulation, coding, and channel conditions. Each signal recording contains **512 I/Q samples**, randomly extracted from the **data field of IEEE 802.11 frames**. This dataset is made publicly available for use in RF signal processing and deep learning research.
